# Custom JUnit test formatter and test runner

The custom test runner allows Defects4J to run a single test case.

The custom formatter outputs executed and failing tests, following Defects4J's
naming conventions for test entries.

* Run `ant test` to compile and test the formatter implementation.

* Run `ant jar` to build and deploy the *formatter.jar*.
