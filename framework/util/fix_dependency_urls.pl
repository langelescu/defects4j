=head1 NAME

fix_dependency_urls.pl -- replace broken dependency URLs in a build file, based
                          on a set of patterns.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    fix_dependency_urls.pl -f build_file [-p pattern_file] [-M]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item -f F<build_file>

The build file for which dependency URLs should be fixed (in-place).

=item -p F<pattern_file>

The file that lists all search and replace regexes (optional). Each row in this
file has to have two comma-separated columns: (1) search pattern and (2) replace
pattern. Comment lines starting with '#' are ignored. The default pattern file
is F<fix_dependency_urls.patterns> in this directory. 

=item -M

Multi-line matching. If set, the content of the build file is treated as a
single string and the search pattern is matched beyond newlines (see /ms
modifiers for perl regexes).

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parses the F<build_file> and replaces all URLs that match a pattern in
F<pattern_file>. This script overrides the existing build file, after creating a
copy, named <build_file>.bak. By default, this scripts uses, as the pattern file,
F<fix_dependency_urls.patterns> in this directory.
